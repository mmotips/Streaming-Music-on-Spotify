# Got Better at Streaming Music Early on Spotify

I love discovering new music the moment it’s released, but I quickly realized that Spotify doesn’t always drop new tracks at the same time worldwide. Being stuck in one country meant waiting longer for some of my favorite artists to release songs. Since Spotify uses your IP address to decide what’s available, I needed a way to “change location” without moving.

I tried a couple of methods, including VPNs, but those often slowed my connection or caused interruptions while streaming. Then I found [9Proxy](https://9proxy.com?utm_source=web20&utm_id=donne123/), which made a big difference. With 9Proxy, I could easily switch my IP to countries where releases came out earlier, and the [connection](https://9proxy.com/?utm_source=web20&utm_id=donne123) was stable and fast—no annoying buffering or dropouts.
